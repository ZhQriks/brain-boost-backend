  "description": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change and motion. It encompasses two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus focuses on the concept of derivatives, which measures the rate of change of a function at a given point. Integral calculus, on the other hand, deals with the concept of integrals, which calculates the accumulation of quantities over a given interval.",
